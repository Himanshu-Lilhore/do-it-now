do-it-now (initial draft):

make a dice starting from 1/2 1/2 probability for both the thing but with each roll it starts getting biased toward unfavourable taks (work).

- streaks (unlock a reward on break record for a streak)
- earn currency through successfully doing a task (with currency you can buy off work tasks)
- badges (show badges like max streak etc)
- implement a feature to save reward for later roll (if you want to work instead on that roll)
- roll cooldown (you can't roll for a certain period of time after doing it once)(to avoid exploitation & to follow the task assigned on that roll)
- randomization of no. of coins earned on each task completion.
- No. of coins earned should also depend of complexity and time spent on a task
